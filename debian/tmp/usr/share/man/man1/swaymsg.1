.SH NAME
.P
swaymsg - Send messages to a running instance of sway over the IPC socket.
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fIswaymsg\fR [options...] [message]
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-h, --help\fR
.RS 4
Show help message and quit.
.P
.RE
\fB-m, --monitor\fR
.RS 4
Monitor for responses until killed instead of exiting after the first
response. This can only be used with the IPC message type \fIsubscribe\fR. If
there is a malformed response or an invalid event type was requested,
swaymsg will stop monitoring and exit.
.P
.RE
\fB-p, --pretty\fR
.RS 4
Use pretty output even when not using a tty.
.P
.RE
\fB-q, --quiet\fR
.RS 4
Sends the IPC message but does not print the response from sway.
.P
.RE
\fB-r, --raw\fR
.RS 4
Use raw output even if using a tty.
.P
.RE
\fB-s, --socket\fR <path>
.RS 4
Use the specified socket path. Otherwise, swaymsg will ask sway where the
socket is (which is the value of $SWAYSOCK, then of $I3SOCK).
.P
.RE
\fB-t, --type\fR <type>
.RS 4
Specify the type of IPC message. See below.
.P
.RE
\fB-v, --version\fR
.RS 4
Print the version (of swaymsg) and quit.
.P
.RE
.SH IPC MESSAGE TYPES
.P
\fB<command>\fR
.RS 4
The message is a sway command (the same commands you can bind to keybindings
in your sway config file). It will be executed immediately.
.P
See \fB\fRsway\fB\fR(5) for a list of commands.
.P
Tip: If you are proving a command that contains a leading hyphen (\fI-\fR),
insert two hyphens (\fI--\fR) before the command to signal to swaymsg not to
parse anything beyond that point as an option. For example, use
\fIswaymsg -- mark --add test\fR instead of \fIswaymsg mark --add test\fR
