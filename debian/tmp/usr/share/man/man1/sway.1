.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
sway was created to fill the need of an i3-like window manager for Wayland. The
upstream i3 developers have no intention of porting i3 to Wayland, and projects
proposed by others ended up as vaporware. Many thanks to the i3 folks for
providing such a great piece of software, so good that your users would rather
write an entirely new window manager from scratch that behaved \fIexactly\fR like i3
rather than switch to something else.
.P
You can run sway directly from a tty, or via a Wayland-compatible login manager.
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
sway searches for a config file in the following locations, in this order:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'1.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 1. 4
.\}
~/.sway/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'2.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 2. 4
.\}
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config (suggested location)
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'3.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 3. 4
.\}
~/.i3/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'4.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 4. 4
.\}
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'5.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 5. 4
.\}
/etc/sway/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'6.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 6. 4
.\}
/etc/i3/config

.RE
.P
If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to \fB~/.config\fR.
.P
An error is raised when no config file is found. The recommended default
configuration is usually installed to \fB/etc/sway/config\fR; you are encouraged to
copy this to \fB~/.config/sway/config\fR and edit it from there.
.P
For information on the config file format, see \fBsway\fR(5).
.P
.SH IPC COMMANDS
.P
Though \fBswaymsg\fR(1) is generally preferred, you may run \fBsway\fR \fIcommand\fR to
send \fIcommand\fR to the running instance of sway. You can also issue commands
with \fBi3-msg\fR(1) or even with \fBi3\fR(1).
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
The following environment variables have an effect on sway:
.P
\fISWAYSOCK\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the path to the sway IPC socket.

\fBsway-input\fR(5).
.P
.RE

.P
