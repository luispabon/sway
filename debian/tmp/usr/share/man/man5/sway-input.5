sway-input - input configuration file and commands
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Sway allows for configuration of devices within the sway configuration file.
To obtain a list of available device identifiers, run \fBswaymsg -t get_inputs\fR.
Settings can also be applied to all input devices by using the wildcard, \fI*\fR,
in place of \fI<identifier>\fR in the commands below. In addition, the settings
can be applied to a type of device, by using \fItype:<input_type>\fR in place
of \fI<identifier>\fR.
.P
Tip: If the configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could
try using \fI*\fR instead of \fI<identifier>\fR. If it works with the wildcard, try
using a different identifier from \fBswaymsg -t get_inputs\fR until you find the
correct input device.
.P
Current available input types are:

.SS MAPPING CONFIGURATION
.P
\fBinput\fR <identifier> map_to_output <identifier>
.RS 4
Maps inputs from this device to the specified output. Only meaningful if the
device is a pointer, touch, or drawing tablet device.
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> map_to_region <WxH@X,Y>
.RS 4
Maps inputs from this device to the specified region of the global output
layout. Only meaningful if the device is a pointer, touch, or drawing tablet
device.
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> map_from_region <X1xY1> <X2xY2>
.RS 4
Ignores inputs from this device that do not occur within the specified
region. Can be in millimeters (e.g. 10x20mm 20x40mm) or in terms of 0..1
(e.g. 0.5x0.5 0.7x0.7). Not all devices support millimeters. Only meaningful
if the device is not a keyboard an provides events in absolute terms (such
as a drawing tablet or touch screen - most pointers provide events relative
to the previous frame).
.P
.RE
.SS LIBINPUT CONFIGURATION
.P
\fBinput\fR <identifier> accel_profile adaptive|flat
.RS 4
Sets the pointer acceleration profile for the specified input device.
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> click_method none|button_areas|clickfinger
.RS 4
Changes the click method for the specified device.
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> drag enabled|disabled

\fBinput\fR <identifier> events enabled|disabled|disabled_on_external_mouse|toggle [<toggle-modes>]
.RS 4
Enables or disables send_events for specified input device. Disabling
send_events disables the input device.
.P
The \fItoggle\fR option cannot be used in the config. If no toggle modes are
listed, all supported modes for the device will be toggled through in the
order: enabled,	disabled_on_external_mouse, disabled, (loop back). If
toggle modes are listed, they will be cycled through, defaulting to the
first mode listed if the current mode is not in the list. They will also
not be checked to see if they are supported for the device and may fail.
.P

be given as an event name or code, which can be obtained from `libinput
debug-events`, or as a x11 mouse button (button[1-3,8,9]). If set to
\fIdisable\fR, it disables the scroll_method on_button_down.
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> scroll_factor <floating point value>
.RS 4
Changes the scroll factor for the specified input device. Scroll speed will
be scaled by the given value, which must be non-negative.

.SS SEAT CONFIGURATION
.P
Configure options for multiseat mode.
.P
A \fBseat\fR is a collection of input devices that act independently of each other.
Seats are identified by name and the default seat is \fIseat0\fR if no seats are
configured. While sway is running, \fI-\fR (hyphen) can be used as an alias for the
current seat. Each seat has an independent keyboard focus and a separate cursor
that is controlled by the pointer devices of the seat. This is useful for
multiple people using the desktop at the same time with their own devices (each
sitting in their own "seat"). The wildcard character, \fI*\fR, can also be used in
place of \fI<identifier>\fR to change settings for all seats.
.P
Tip: If the configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could
try using \fI*\fR instead of \fI<identifier>\fR. If it works with the wildcard, try
using a different identifier from \fBswaymsg -t get_seats\fR until you find the
correct seat.
.P
\fBseat\fR <name> attach <input_identifier>
.RS 4
Attach an input device to this seat by its input identifier. A special
value of "*" will attach all devices to the seat.
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <seat> cursor move|set <x> <y>
.RS 4
Move specified seat's cursor relative to current position or wrap to
absolute coordinates (with respect to the global coordinate space).
Specifying either value as 0 will not update that coordinate.
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <seat> cursor press|release button[1-9]|<event-name-or-code>
.RS 4
Simulate pressing (or releasing) the specified mouse button on the
specified seat. The button can either be provided as a button event name or
event code, which can be obtained from `libinput debug-events`, or as an x11
mouse button (button[1-9]). If using button[4-7], which map to axes, an axis
event will be simulated, however \fIpress\fR and \fIrelease\fR will be ignored and
both will occur.
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> fallback true|false
.RS 4
Set this seat as the fallback seat. A fallback seat will attach any device
not explicitly attached to another seat (similar to a "default" seat).
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> hide_cursor <timeout>
.RS 4
Hides the cursor image after the specified \fItimeout\fR (in milliseconds)
has elapsed with no activity on that cursor. A timeout of 0 (default)
disables hiding the cursor. The minimal timeout is 100 and any value less
than that (aside from 0), will be increased to 100.
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> pointer_constraint enable|disable|escape
.RS 4
Enables or disables the ability for clients to capture the cursor (enabled
by default) for the seat. This is primarily useful for video games. The
"escape" command can be used at runtime to escape from a captured client.
