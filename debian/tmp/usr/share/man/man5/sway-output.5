.SH NAME

sway-output - output configuration commands for sway
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
You may combine output commands into one, like so:
.P
.RS 4
output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 pos 1920,0 bg ~/wallpaper.png stretch
.P
.RE
You can get a list of output names with \fBswaymsg -t get_outputs\fR. You may also
match any output by using the output name "*".
.P
Some outputs may have different names when disconnecting and reconnecting. To
identify these, the name can be substituted for a string consisting of the make,
model and serial which you can get from \fBswaymsg -t get_outputs\fR. Each value
must be separated by one space. For example:
.P
.RS 4
output "Some Company ABC123 0x00000000" pos 1920,0
.P
.RE
.SH COMMANDS
.P
\fBoutput\fR <name> mode|resolution|res <WIDTHxHEIGHT>[@<RATE>[Hz]]
.RS 4
Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a
combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your
display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each
output, use \fBswaymsg -t get_outputs\fR.
.P
Examples:
.P
.RS 4
output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080
.P
output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz
.P
.RE
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> position|pos <X> <Y>
.RS 4
Places the specified output at the specific position in the global
coordinate space. The cursor may only be moved between immediately
adjacent outputs. If scaling is active, it has to be considered when
positioning. For example, if the scaling factor for the left output is
2, the relative position for the right output has to be divided by 2.
The reference point is the top left corner so if you want the bottoms
aligned this has to be considered as well.
.P
Example:
.P
.RS 4
output HDMI1 scale 2
.P
output HDMI1 pos 0 1020 res 3200x1800
.P
output eDP1 pos 1600 0 res 1920x1080
.P
.RE
Note that the left x-pos of eDP1 is 1600 = 3200/2 and the bottom y-pos is
1020 + (1800 / 2) = 1920 = 0 + 1920
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> scale <factor>
.RS 4
Scales the specified output by the specified scale \fIfactor\fR. An integer is
recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional
value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully
represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next
highest integral scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by
setting an integral scale factor and adjusting the font size of your
applications to taste. HiDPI isn't supported with Xwayland clients (windows
will blur).
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> subpixel rgb|bgr|vrgb|vbgr|none
.RS 4
Manually sets the subpixel hinting for the specified output. This value is
usually auto-detected, but some displays may misreport their subpixel
geometry. Using the correct subpixel hinting allows for sharper text.
Incorrect values will result in blurrier text. When changing this via
\fBswaymsg\fR, some applications may need to be restarted to use the new value.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> background|bg <file> <mode> [<fallback_color>]
.RS 4
Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the
given scaling mode (one of "stretch", "fill", "fit", "center", "tile"). If
the specified file cannot be accessed or if the image does fill the entire
output, a fallback color may be provided to cover the rest of the output.
\fI\fRfallback_color__ should be specified as \fI#RRGGBB\fR. Alpha is not supported.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> background|bg <color> solid_color
.RS 4
Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. \fIcolor\fR
should be specified as \fI#RRGGBB\fR. Alpha is not supported.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> transform <transform> [clockwise|anticlockwise]
.RS 4
Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of "90", "180",
"270" for rotation; or "flipped", "flipped-90", "flipped-180", "flipped-270"
to apply a rotation and flip, or "normal" to apply no transform. If a single
output is chosen and a rotation direction is specified (\fIclockwise\fR or
\fIanticlockwise\fR) then the transform is added or subtracted from the current
transform.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> disable|enable
.RS 4
Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by
default).
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> toggle
.RS 4
Toggle the specified output.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <name> dpms on|off
.RS 4
Enables or disables the specified output via DPMS. To turn an output off
(ie. blank the screen but keep workspaces as-is), one can set DPMS to off.
