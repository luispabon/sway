sway-bar - bar configuration file and commands
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Sway allows configuring swaybar in the sway configuration file.
.P
.SH COMMANDS
.P
The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.
.P
\fBid\fR <bar_id>
.RS 4
Sets the ID of the bar.
.P
.RE
\fBswaybar_command\fR <command>
.RS 4
Executes custom bar command. Default is \fIswaybar\fR.
.P
.RE
The following commands may be used either in the configuration file or at
runtime.
.P
\fBbindcode\fR [--release] <event-code> <command>
.RS 4
Executes \fIcommand\fR when the mouse button has been pressed (or if \fIreleased\fR
is given, when the button has been released). The buttons can be given as
an event code, which can be obtaining from \fBlibinput debug-events\fR. To
disable the default behavior for a button, use the command \fInop\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBbindsym\fR [--release] button[1-9]|<event-name> <command>
.RS 4
Executes \fIcommand\fR when the mouse button has been pressed (or if \fIreleased\fR
is given, when the button has been released). The buttons can be given as a
x11 button number or an event name, which can be obtained from \fBlibinput
debug-events\fR. To disable the default behavior for a button, use the
command \fInop\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBbinding_mode_indicator\fR yes|no
.RS 4
Enable or disable binding mode indicator. Default is \fIyes\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBfont\fR <font>
.RS 4
Specifies the font to be used in the bar. \fIfont\fR should be specified as a
pango font description. For more information on pango font descriptions,
see https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Fonts.html#pango-font-description-from-string
.P
.RE
\fBgaps\fR <all> | <horizontal> <vertical> | <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
.RS 4
Sets the gaps from the edge of the screen for the bar. Gaps can either be
set all at once, per direction, or per side. Note that only sides that
touch an edge of the screen can have gaps. For the side that does not
touch an edge of the screen, per-side outer gaps for workspaces may be of
use.
.P
.RE
\fBheight\fR <height>
.RS 4
Sets the height of the bar. Default height (0) will match the font size.
.P
.RE
\fBhidden_state\fR hide|show [<bar-id>]
.RS 4
Specifies the behaviour of the bar when it is in \fIhide\fR mode. When the
hidden state is \fIhide\fR, then it is normally hidden, and only unhidden by
pressing the modifier key or in case of urgency hints. When the hidden
state is \fIshow\fR, then it is permanently visible, drawn on top of the
currently visible workspace. Default is \fIhide\fR.
.P
For compatibility with i3, \fIbar hidden_state hide|show [<bar-id>]\fR is
supported along with the sway only \fIbar <bar-id> hidden_state hide|show\fR
syntax. When using the i3 syntax, if \fIbar-id\fR is omitted, the hidden_state
will be changed for all bars. Attempting to use \fIbar <bar-id1>
hidden_state hide|show <bar-id2>\fR will result in an error due to
conflicting bar ids.
.P
.RE
\fBmode\fR dock|hide|invisible|overlay [<bar-id>]
.RS 4
Specifies the visibility of the bar. In \fIdock\fR mode, it is permanently
visible at one edge of the screen. In \fIhide\fR mode, it is hidden unless the
modifier key is pressed, though this behaviour depends on the hidden state.
In \fIinvisible\fR mode, it is permanently hidden. In \fIoverlay\fR mode, it is
permanently visible on top of other windows. (In \fIoverlay\fR mode the bar is
transparent to input events.) Default is \fIdock\fR.
.P
For compatibility with i3, \fIbar mode <mode> [<bar-id>]\fR syntax is supported
along with the sway only \fIbar <bar-id> mode <mode>\fR syntax. When using the
i3 syntax, if \fIbar-id\fR is omitted, the mode will be changed for all bars.
Attempting to use \fIbar <bar-id1> mode <mode> <bar-id2>\fR will result in an
error due to conflicting bar ids.
.P
.RE
\fBmodifier\fR <Modifier>|none
.RS 4
Specifies the modifier key that shows a hidden bar. Default is \fIMod4\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <output>|*
.RS 4
Restrict the bar to a certain output, can be specified multiple times. If
the output command is omitted, the bar will be displayed on all outputs. \fI*\fR
can be given at any point to reset it back to all outputs.
.P
.RE
\fBpango_markup\fR enabled|disabled
.RS 4
Enables or disables pango markup for status lines. This has no effect on
status lines using the i3bar JSON protocol.
.P
.RE
\fBposition\fR top|bottom
.RS 4
Sets position of the bar. Default is \fIbottom\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBseparator_symbol\fR <symbol>
.RS 4
Specifies the separator symbol to separate blocks on the bar.
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_command\fR <status command>
.RS 4
Executes the bar \fIstatus command\fR with \fIsh -c\fR. Each line of text printed
to stdout from this command will be displayed in the status area of the
bar. You may also use swaybar's JSON status line protocol. See
\fBswaybar-protocol\fR(7) for more information on the protocol
.P
If running this command via IPC, you can disable a running status command by
setting the command to a single dash: \fIswaybar bar bar-0 status_command -\fR
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_edge_padding\fR <padding>
.RS 4
Sets the padding that is used when the status line is at the right edge of
the bar. This value will be multiplied by the output scale. The default is
\fI3\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_padding\fR <padding>
.RS 4
Sets the vertical padding that is used for the status line. The default is
\fI1\fR. If \fIpadding\fR is \fI0\fR, blocks will be able to take up the full height of
the bar. This value will be multiplied by the output scale.
.P
.RE
\fBstrip_workspace_name\fR yes|no
.RS 4
If set to \fIyes\fR, then workspace names will be omitted from the workspace
button and only the custom number will be shown. Default is \fIno\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBstrip_workspace_numbers\fR yes|no
.RS 4
If set to \fIyes\fR, then workspace numbers will be omitted from the workspace
button and only the custom name will be shown. Default is \fIno\fR.
.P
.RE

.P
.RE
\fBunbindsym\fR [--release] button[1-9]|<event-name>
.RS 4
Removes the binding with the given <button> or <event-name>.
.P
.RE

.RS 4
Enables or disables wrapping when scrolling through workspaces with the
scroll wheel. Default is \fIno\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBworkspace_buttons\fR yes|no
.RS 4
Enables or disables workspace buttons on the bar. Default is \fIyes\fR.
.P
.RE
.SS TRAY
.P
Swaybar provides a system tray where third-party applications may place icons.
The following commands configure the tray.
.P
\fBtray_bindcode\fR <event-code>
ContextMenu|Activate|SecondaryActivate|ScrollDown|ScrollLeft|ScrollRight|ScrollUp|nop
.RS 4
Executes the action when the mouse button has been pressed. The buttons can
be given as an event code, which can be obtained from \fBlibinput debug-events\fR.
To disable the default behavior for a button, use the command \fInop\fR.
.P
.RE
\fBtray_bindsym\fR button[1-9]|<event-name>
ContextMenu|Activate|SecondaryActivate|ScrollDown|ScrollLeft|ScrollRight|ScrollUp|nop
.RS 4
Executes the action when the mouse button has been pressed. The buttons can
be given as a x11 button number or an event name, which can be obtained
from \fBlibinput debug-events\fR. Use the command \fInop\fR to disable the default
action (Activate for button1, ContextMenu for button2 and SecondaryActivate
for button3).
.P
.RE
\fBtray_padding\fR <px> [px]
.RS 4
Sets the pixel padding of the system tray. This padding will surround the
tray on all sides and between each item. The default value for \fIpx\fR is 2.
.P
.RE
\fBtray_output\fR none|<output>|*
.RS 4
Restrict the tray to a certain output, can be specified multiple times. If
omitted, the tray will be displayed on all outputs. Unlike i3bar, swaybar
can show icons on any number of bars and outputs without races. \fI*\fR can be
given at any point to reset it to display on all outputs.
.P
.RE
\fBicon_theme\fR <name>
.RS 4
Sets the icon theme that sway will look for item icons in. This option has
no default value, because sway will always default to the fallback theme,
hicolor.
.P
.RE
.SS COLORS
